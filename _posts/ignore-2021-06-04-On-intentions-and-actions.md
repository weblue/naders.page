## How do we measure ourselves as good or bad?

As we're all told over and over again, to be human is to be imperfect. We hear it in songs, movies, and books, we're told to forgive ourselves for it, we're told to accept it. No matter what we do, our imperfections define us as people. Those imperfections extend to every part of our  extend to our _actions_.


This makes it difficult to measure the "goodness" or evil of individuals and their actions.
