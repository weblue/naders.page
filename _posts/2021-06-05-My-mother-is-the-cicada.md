Like the cicada, my mother is unyielding. The cicada can be obnoxious and overwhelmingly annoying. But it still commands respect. Through overwhelming force, it pushes through life and nature; against all odds, it succeeds in its goal.

Out of sight, it does a lot to keep it's world moving forward, hidden away fulfilling it's obligations. But sometimes it's not so silent. 

We don't think of how much it can do over the years, but when it comes time to remind you of it's presence, there's no denying it. But God is it annoying.
