Exploring through forums brought me to a question I had heard before; is programming in your 40s a dead end? Over the course of a career, do programmers have to choose between a move to management or becoming outdated resources?

As programmers and software engineers, the only constant in the field is **change**. Good code doesn't necessarily change often, but the tools and times always do and programmers need to take account to stay relevant in the field. Just as doctors constantly look for more effective, safer, or quick procedures to treat illness, engineers must stay at the edge of technology to keep their solutions viable as the field and their careers keep moving.

To me, this means that **being a software engineer is a never-ending pursuit to understand how the field evolves, and figuring out which of those changes are impactful**.

Without this ambition to stay ahead of the curve, engineers may find themselves being pushed in a direction they might not appreciate; however, many find this effort exhausting and might find it more comfortable to dive deeply into research or academia. Even then, not understanding how to keep up with any field is programmer's death sentence.

Naturally, what I wanted to know was <u>"how can we keep growing as developers?"</u>. And this lead me to wonder where anyone would start.

## How can we stay aware of the field?
Staying on the edge requires commitment and passion! Building on that commitment, there's a few resources that are worth checking out daily/weekly:

### [HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com)
HackerNews is a technology news aggregator from tech venture capital firm, [ycombinator](https://ycombinator.com). This is a great way to browse a broad set of headlines and find a wide variety of interesting tech news.

### [ThoughtWorks TechRadar](https://www.thoughtworks.com/radar)

### [Microsoft's Channel9](https://channel9.msdn.com)
TODO
### [Github Trending](https://github.com/trending)
Projects and developers getting recent attention on Github.
### Googling "Best tech to do ____"
TODO

This list gives a couple of places to start on some broad subjects, but there's always the more focused newsletters on useful products or even discussions/news on the programming subreddit.

With all the awareness in the world, however, there's no replacement for getting hands on with new tools and technology. Depending on time and interest, that can be as simple as a hello world and as complex as an entire project from scratch. It's happened more than once where learning a new technology at work coincided with a hobby project; to prepare for a work project, putting together a home project in Vue.js is infinitely more helpful than just reading articles about it.

## Recognizing value and separating out fads
With all the new technologies that emerge every day, there's just as many fads and marketing schemes as there are useful or practical tools. Even if every project was interesting, it'd be impossible to implement more than a handful.

## Signs you or your company might be getting stale
